# Charcoal HTTP Client

The HTTP Client library provides a framework-native way to send HTTP requests in Charcoal, built atop HTTP Commons for
consistent request/response handling. It offers a clean API for composing requests, managing headers, timeouts, and
retries, with hooks for logging, tracing, and error handling so outbound calls integrate smoothly with the appâ€™s
lifecycle.

For detailed information, guidance, and setup instructions regarding this library, please refer to our official
